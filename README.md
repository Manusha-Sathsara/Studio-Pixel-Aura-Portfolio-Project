##Studio PixelAura Portfolio

This is the official portfolio website for Studio PixelAura, designed to showcase our creative projects and services in a visually captivating, user-friendly manner.
Made using HTML, CSS, and JS. 

Please note that an active internet connection is required to load the Google fonts and font awesome icons.

Most of the design images I used are my own designs and I plan to keep developing this website as my actual graphic design portfolio.
